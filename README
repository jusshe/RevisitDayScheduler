/* Revisit Day Scheduler

This is a scheduler I created to help out my high school's 
admissions staff. It's tailored exclusively to revisit days
in which accepted students sit in on two classes during one 
schedule block. Reads from an exported google form of student 
preferences and creates a directory with a final schedule & 
performance summary. 

Past Versions: This is techinally "RevisitDayScheduler3.0" :/
I tried originally to model the problem
as a maxflow problem, but I believe (though haven't proven)
that two of the characteristics I would need to represent in 
the digraph are mutually exclusive.
